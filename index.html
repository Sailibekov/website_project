            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
              Understanding factors that affect student performance is crucial for assessing the current methods and standards of education. Factors such as school type, attendance, parental involvement, access to resources, hours studied, and many more contribute to the performance of students in the classroom.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this project, we aim to analyze the factors that contribute the most to academic performance and how these variables work together to influence student outcomes (exam scores). By examining both individual and systemic factors, we hope to identify patterns that can inform more effective educational practices and policies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking at student performance through these factors can offer insight on current education systems, highlighting areas where interventions may be necessary. For instance, limited access to academic support or a lack of engagement at home can significantly limit a student’s ability to succeed, while environments that promote structured learning, active parental involvement, and resource availability often see better academic outcomes.
            </p>
